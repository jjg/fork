I can't tell you how many times I've had someone jokingly discuss cloning me.  I've always taken it seriously, I mean what I do professionally, from their perspective, wouldn't require any medical miracle to recreate.  In fact it wouldn't require recreating my physical form at all, just a shallow copy of my intellectual capabilities, that would be capable of interacting with systems that are themselves digital, virtual and networked.  I took this seriously.

There were other contributing factors.  I love to code, but being a "developer" involves a lot more than writing code, and as I became more experienced as a programmer these non-coding activities took up more and more of my time.  For some of my contemporaries this was a welcome repreive from the ever-changing world of software development and they welcomed working at a higher level of abstraction and deligating the coding "grunt work" to the new kids.  I tried to follow this path like a grown-up but it never felt right, and for all it's advantages in compensation and respect, I always found myself gravitating back to the text editor.

Cloning, in the digital sense, therefore had the attraction of being able to off-load or "outsource" these non-coding aspects of my work to something of a digital copy of myself, and in this way I could actually justify the work (who could argue with being able to get more billable work done?).  So I began to pursue the work under the guise of building a virtual assistant or secretary who could run interference between me and the outside world while I hacked away at my most recent piece of software.
